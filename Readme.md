5.16 - Bonus Exercise: Connect Four OOP
- Your job is to create Connect Four in Ruby (like the previous bonus exercise), but this time using classes and object oriented principles to structure your code.


5.17 - Bonus Exercise: Tic Tac Toe

- Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

- Try using classes to structure your code. 

5.18 - Bonus Algorithm Challenge: Linear and Binary Search

- The goal of this exercise is to implement your own search from scratch (without using Ruby's #index method!)

- The approach you will implement is called linear search. A linear search takes a sorted array and an item to find in the array, then checks each item in the sorted array one at a time from the beginning until you find the desired item. You can see a visual example below (here we're searching the array [10, 14, 19, 26, 27, 31, 33, 35, 42, 44] for the value of 33):
