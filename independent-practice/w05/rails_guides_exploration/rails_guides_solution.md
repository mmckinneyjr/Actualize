#### Answer the following questions:

1. When do you think using scaffolding would be useful?
   When you have built a nice template as a good starting off point and when you are building cookie cutter type of applications

2. When do you think scaffolding would be more trouble than it's worth?
   When you want a lot customizations built into the basics

3. Did you learn anything interesting reading the rails documentation?
   The documation a is actually a little outdated and took some additional reading to get the posts pasge to load and working properly. But I did learn that it can and may be very benefitcial as well as time saving and cost effective for a company to scaffold apps for clients who have cookie cutter type of basic needs. It would make knocking out and producing apps much quicker and easier. It kind of reminds me of word press style of applications.
