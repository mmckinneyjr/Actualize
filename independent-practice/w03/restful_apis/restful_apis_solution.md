### If we made an API for events happening in San Francisco... 
1. What would be the HTTP verb and url combination that would retrieve a list of all events?
    GET http://localhost:3000/movies.json

2. What would be the HTTP verb and url combination that would retrieve the event with id of 4?
    GET http://localhost:3000/movies/2.json

3. If you saw the HTTP verb and url combination "POST /events", using REST principles what action would it be performing? 
    it would be creating a new object

4. What is the `:id` portion of the route doing? Why do we use id? 
    it is a parameter variable used to capture users input. We use id because we are searching base on an objects database id.
