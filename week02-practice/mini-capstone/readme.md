Exercise: Begin the mini capstone. Where do you start?
1 - Create a new rails api app called mini-capstone with a postgres database:
rails new mini-capstone-api
cd mini-capstone-api
1.a - Use git to add and commit your code.
1.b - Use GitHub to create a repo called mini-capstone-api, then copy and paste the commands to push your git repo to GitHub.
2 -  Create a products controller (plural!)
2.a Use git to add, commit, and push your code.
3 - Create a Product model (singular!). Some important attributes include name, price (integer), image_url, and description.
3.a - Use git to add, commit, and push your code.
4 - Create products either in the rails console or using the db/seeds.rb file with the rails db:seed command!
4.a - Use git to add, commit, and push your code.
5 - Create a route that displays JSON for all the available products.
5.a - Use git to add, commit, and push your code.
6 - Make some routes to display JSON for individual products. What is inconvenient about this process?
6.a - Use git to add, commit, and push your code.
Bonus: Make a Ruby frontend script using the HTTP gem to display the results in the terminal instead of a web browser!
Bonus: In your Ruby frontend script, use the tty-table gem (https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-table) to print out the results with tables in the terminal!
After you complete your app, you can make your own cheat sheet to gather all instructions in one place. Annotate each instruction to explain what it means.
